== Setup ==

To setup the application, proceed as follows:

  # Download a public release of CandyDollDB, or check out a the most current release in SubVersion.
  # Place the application in a directory accessable through a webserver (e.g. `/var/www/cdtvdb/`).
  # Check if the configuration-file (`config.php`) already exists. If it does, remove it.<br>All subsequent page-requests will be redirected to `setup.php`.
  # Enter all the required data, e.g. datbase connection data, user account data, SMTP connection data.<br>If all goes well, you should then be prompted to log in.

Meanwhile, the file `config.php` has been written to your installation directory.<br>It contains all the settings you provided, and a few more.

Among those are the e-mailtemplate to use when a user forgot her/his password and the user-id of the first user to be setup; this will be used for commandline-authentication (see section [WikiSyntax#Batch-imports Batch-imports]).

Once you are logged in, you can start importing models and sets:

  # Make sure you use the most up-to-date XML-file with all model- and setdata.<br>The XML-file can be downloaded from the Downloads-page.
  # Click the 'Process XML-data' button on the main page (`index.php`).<br>This can take a while.
  # Now you can import images and videos into their corresponding sets.<br>You can either
    * do it manually (great fun, if you've got some time to kill), or
    * do it automatically (see section [WikiSyntax#Batch-imports Batch-imports]).

== Batch-imports ==

Because of the long duration of an all-images-all-videos-import, it is best to do this on the commandline of your server. There, no HTTP-time-out exists. In the next examples, the application is located in /var/www/cdtvdb/ on a GNU/Linux system with PHP5.

Open a terminal and enter the following command to import all images:

{{{
$ php5 -f /var/www/cdtvdb/import_image.php
}}}

For importing videos, use the following:

{{{
$ php5 -f /var/www/cdtvdb/import_video.php
}}}
