== Must Have ==

  * Import file with all models and sets tagged

  * Usable and efficient tag-searching capabilities

  * Lots of feedback :-)

== Could Use ==

  * Internationalization of the user-interface.

  * Comprehensive tag-structure for handling e.g. colors, sizes, etc.

  * Multiple lay-out themes (header/footers), possibly switchable

  * URL-rewrite compatibility. Apache, IIS or both?

  * HTML5-interface instead of XHTML 1.0 Strict

  * Usage-reports on non-Linux platforms, for inter-platform testing of filehandling, imports and downloads

  * More flexible and robust filename-handling (no hardcoded prefixes during import)

  * Multi-threadedness. Currently only one concurrent user is allowed for imports

  * Automatic updateing, automatic downloading and installing of new releases

  * User roles/rights for allowing per-user permissions (login, import, export, download, add, edit, delete...)

== Would Be Nice ==

  * Overlay with loading-animation during lengthy imports (for example using AJAX)

  * More complete list of the models's lastnames and birthdates<br>(currently 79/93 have a known birthdate and 32/93 a known lastname)
