== Must Have ==

  * Lots of feedback :-)

== Could Use ==

  * Multiple lay-out themes (header/footers), possibly switchable.

  * URL-rewrite compatibility. Apache, IIS or both?

  * HTML5-interface instead of XHTML 1.0 Strict.

  * Usage-reports on non-Linux platforms, for inter-platform testing of filehandling, imports and downloads.

  * 'remember-me' option when logging in<br>(currently not implemented because of the use of SESSION[])

  * More flexible and robust filename-handling<br>(no hardcoded prefixes during import)

  * Multi-threadedness. Currently only one concurrent user is allowed for imports.

  * Automatic updateing, automatic downloading and installing of new releases.

== Would Be Nice ==

  * Overlay with loading-animation during lengthy imports (for example using AJAX)

  * More complete list of the models's lastnames and birthdates<br>(currently 79/93 have a known birthdate and 32/93 a known lastname)

  * Automatic import of CD-updates<br>(for example a scheduled wget-request of the updatepage, then parsing the response)
