= Roadmap =

== Must Have ==

  * More feedback :-)

== Could Use ==

  * 'remember-me' option when logging in<br>(currently not implemented because of the use of SESSION[])

  * More robust filename-handling<br>(no hardcoded prefixes during import)

== Would Be Nice ==

  * Automatic import of updates<br>(for example a scheduled wget-request of the updatepage, then parsing the response)
