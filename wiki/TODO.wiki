= TODO =

== Must Have ==

  * Lots of feedback :-)

  * A downloadable public release. To do that we need:
    * a comprehensible README
    * a clue about what format(s) to use (zip, tar.gz, 7z)
    * ...
    * ...

== Could Use ==

  * Users on non-Linux platforms, for inter-platform testing of filehandling, imports and downloads.

  * ~~More secure accountmanagement<br>(currently using 1 round of SHA1-hashing with 40 characters salting)~~

  * 'remember-me' option when logging in<br>(currently not implemented because of the use of SESSION[])

  * More flexible and robust filename-handling<br>(no hardcoded prefixes during import)

== Would Be Nice ==

  * More complete list of the models's lastnames and birthdates<br>(currently 46/82 have a known birthdate and 32/82 a known lastname)

  * More complete list of the set-releasedates<br>(currently 589/916 have a known releasedate for pictures or video)

  * Automatic import of updates<br>(for example a scheduled wget-request of the updatepage, then parsing the response)
